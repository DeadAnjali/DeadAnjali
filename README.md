### Hello World ðŸ‘‹ 

I am **`Anjali Sharma`** , a budding software artist (I prefer to call myself that) who is interested in anything to everything in the technology world.

Some insights into my recent endeavours:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full stack web-application which is the collaborative learning and competitions organising tool for my passion project `Ada's Code Cafe`
- ðŸŒ± I recently navigated through the waters of Block-Chain and learnt about this buzz word
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to forward to making meaningful Open Source Contributions and upskilling myself to do the same
- ðŸ¤” A friend of mine has spiked my interest in OS development debating the use of Rust against the traditional C++ 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made a Single Page Application purely in HTML, CSS, JS to simulate one of the features of React
